<h3>Hello World! </h3>
<p>My name is Kahli, and I am a Computer Science Student at the University of Texas. I am also a part-time employee working in the IT department at UT. I was born in Austin, raised in Austin, and have also made Austin my college town. Oddly enough, with its rapid growth, Austin has become one of the next biggest tech boom towns, which ironically and coincidentally match up with my career field. Life has carved a pretty simple path for me, it seems.</p>

<h3>Coursework </h3>

<p>
Currently, as of Fall 2015, I'm taking these classes:
  <ul>
