This past Friday marked the conclusion of my first week in Software Engineering. Already, I've been consumed with an overwhelming amount of firsts.

**Before I begin**, I would urge anyone to read <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Installed-Ron-Jeffries/dp/0201708426">this</a> book. I cannot be more thankful that it was assigned as a required reading, else I never would have come across it. It gives a remarkabley beautiful overview of the functioning and timespan of extreme programming projects. In a nutshell, the full cycle is discussed, from customer need, to implementation, to the importance of Unit Testing, and finally, to deployement. As students with very little real-world job experience, it was a pleasure to sneek a peak of aspects of software enginnering **other than programming**. 

What's more beautiful is its relevance to this class. (... to be continued)
