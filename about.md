  Hey there! My name is Kahli, and I'm a CS Student at the University of Texas.
</p>

I'm a student and part-time employee working in the IT department at UT. I was born in Austin, raised in Austin, and have also made Austin my college town. Oddly enough, with its rapid growth, Austin has become one of the next biggest tech boom towns, which ironically and coincidentally match up with my career field. Life has carved a pretty simple path for me, it seems.

I'm currently taking these classes:

* [CS 373 Software Engineering](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/)
* [CS 361 Intro to Computer Security](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs361/syllabus361.html)

My hobbies consist of Rock Climbing, playing in Steel Bands, learning new things, and creating my own little tools/gadgets for my daily life.
